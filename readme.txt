MadStyleTV - Open source project
--------------------------------
The goal of the project is to provide a cross-platform
OpenGL / Multimedia framework, to serve as a guide for
learning C++, OpenGL and multimedia technologies.

OpenGL 3.2 core profile is utilized to be compatible
with OSX.

C++11 is the version of choice.  It's stable enough
on Windows for multithreaded support now.

Project build files for Visual Studio 2013 are provided
as that version is available for free as the Community
Edition.  Also provided are XCode project files for OSX
users.

Makefiles will be provided for Linux, possibly Eclipse
projects as well.

Source code version control is Subversion, that being
the author's personal preference.
