1. Overview
===========
The library is compiled using GCC version 4.5. The files that have been provided with this release are:

1.1) AN_178_User Guide for LibMPSSE-SPI.pdf - The user manual for libMPSSE-SPI
1.2) Release_Notes.txt - This file
1.3) include/libMPSSE_spi.h - The header file for libMPSSE-SPI
1.4) include/windows/ftd2xx.h - The header file for D2XX windows driver
1.5) include/linux/ftd2xx.h - The header file for D2XX linux driver
1.6) include/linux/WinTypes.h - Header file required required by ftd2xx.h
1.7) lib/windows/i386/libMPSSE.a - libMPSSE static library for windows
1.8) lib/windows/i386/libMPSSE.dll - libMPSSE dynamic library for windows
1.9) lib/linux/i386/libMPSSE.a - libMPSSE static library for 32bit linux
1.10) lib/linux/i386/libMPSSE.so - libMPSSE dynamic library for 32bit linux
1.11) lib/linux/x86_64/libMPSSE.a - libMPSSE static library for 64bit linux
1.12) lib/linux/x86_64/libMPSSE.so - libMPSSE dynamic library for 64bit linux
1.13) SPI/sample-dynamic.c - Sample code showing the use of libMPSSE as a dynamic library for SPI
1.14) SPI/sample-static.c - Sample code showing the use of libMPSSE as a static library for SPI
1.15) b.bat - A batch file for windows that builds the samples and executes them
1.16) b.bash - A shell script for linux that builds the samples and executes them(requires to be executed from bash shell using root)

2. Installation Procedure
=========================
The D2XX driver(http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm) should be 
installed for libMPSSE to work. 

For linux, the drivers ftdi_sio and usbserial should be removed 
before the D2XX drivers can be used. The library has to be installed at 
/usr/lib (or /usr/lib64) before the application tries to use it.

3. Known Limitations
====================
1) The APIs I2C_GetNumChannels, I2C_GetChannelInfo and I2C_OpenChannel does not 
work when they are called simultaneously from multiple applications at the same time.
2) LatencyTimer should be greater than 0 for FT232H

4. Test Environment
==================
The library has been tested and known to work on a "HP Compaq DX 2710 SF" 
running "Fedora 14" distribution with linux kernel 2.6.38. The hardware 
that has been tested consists of a FT2232H-Mini-Module connected 
to a 93LC56B EEPROM chip. 

5. Change log
================================
12 December 2011
----------------
1) Added new function SPI_ReadWrite that clocks data in and out simultaneously
2) Added functionality to Read/Write multiple bytes per USB frame when SPI_TRANSFER_OPTION_SIZE_IN_BYTES bit is set in transferOptions
3) Added 64bit linux support
4) Adapted to new release folder structure - unified sample code for windows & linux
5) Updated build scripts
6) Bug Fixed: sizeTransferred used to always return 0 if bit SPI_TRANSFER_OPTION_SIZE_IN_BYTES was set

08 July 2011
------------
1) Added functions Init_libMPSSE and Cleanup_libMPSSE
2) Added functions FT_ReadGPIO & FT_WriteGPIO
3) Added 3-phase clocking functionality. This functionality is enabled by default.

20 May 2011
-----------
1) Change in APIs I2C_GetChannelInfo & I2C_OpenChannel to start indexing channels from 0
2) Solved bug: I2C_GetNumChannels reports only one available channel when FT2232H chip is conected
3) Exported library infrastructure functions for initializing library when used with VC++ in static mode

20 May 2014
-----------
1) Solved bug: Memory leakage in SPI mode
2) Soved bug: MSVC version 2010 release mode compilation failure

03 Sep 2014
-----------
1) Fix Release Package compilation errors and warnings on Linux and Windows
2) Include 64-bit libraries for 64-bit Windows Visual Studio applications
3) Include 32-bit library (.lib) for Visual Studio Debug and Release mode applications
