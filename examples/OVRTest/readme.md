## OVRTest
### Oculus SDK for PC integration (Windows only)
Yes, it's Windows only.  Oculus has made the decision to focus on Windows for marketing reasons, and I can't really blame them for that choice.  Their documentation hints at Linux support, and they claim it's "on the roadmap", but I'm not holding my breath.

So I'm pressing forward with Windows only development with this project, because I've been waiting a LONG time for VR development tools to be available at reasonable cost, and now's the time.  There's a lot to learn about creating immersive experiences, this is my start.
